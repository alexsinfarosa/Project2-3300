The website provides datasets for various European countries, we decided to work with 5 countries. The data on the site are in CSV format and did not need any reformatting nor filtering. At first we were intentioned to convert those files to JSON and combine them together into a unique file. However, later on we opted to keep each country separated and to use CSV format instead. 
The graph provides information on soccer tournaments for the 2013/14 season in selected European countries. The user actively engages with the graph to obtain the desired information. For instance, if the user would like to know the results of any particular team he/she would just need first to click on one of the country buttons on the left of the graph and then select the desired team (Team 1).
